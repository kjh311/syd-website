MUST HAVES: 













Sub cloud building pictures for new pictures

<!-- delete pages that syd no longer wants and correct site maps -->

<!-- bolder font for home slider -->

new headshots on /clergy page, maybe a slider to show multiple imgs

<!-- make sure no src from wpengine site, but from shulcloud -->

new pic of Nestor on /staff



DESIGN FIXES BUT NOT ESSENTIAL:





should i put links at bottom of footer with my link and designer's?


If Syd wants 100s or 1000s of names on the google sheet I'll have to force the results onto different pages within the #json-ul / .table-wrap

fix animation eases on home page

<!-- fix spacing of buttons in footer -->

<!-- figure out how to prevent user from pausing/changing slides of home carousel -->

links in footer should be white and grey on hover

some pages have var(--text-blue) for the underline on hover

when index loads I don't want things bouncing up and down as they load, create empty divs that are same height as what is going to be loaded...or something like that

run code again through auto vendor 

check site with html & css validators

clean up code

erase files not in use from shulcloud
<!-- music on /pray -->

/learn links to youtube classes



FEATURE CREEP: 

add svg animations to buttons on click

svg loading animation

New animation to match the EXISTING temple logo / "Can you put the old logo back where it was and instead find space either somewhere on the homepage or on the “learn” landing page for the awesome animated graphic that you worked up?""
